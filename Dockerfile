# CGO_ENABLED=0 is an environment variable that tells to the compiler to disable the support for linking C code. As a result, the resulting binary will not be able to depend on the C system libraries. The point is that in a scratch container, there are no system libraries. If we omit this directive, the Docker build will terminate successfully, but the resulting container will crash with funny errors.
